## About Me

- Junior Software Developer with hands-on experience building Web Applications and other projects based on Spring Boot, where the communication with the Java backend was made via REST APIs. I've also integrated web applications with PostgreSQL databases deployed in AWS, which is the cloud provider I had contact with. First of many, I hope.
- I've developed frontend interfaces based on JavaScript, HTML and CSS, which gives me the foundations to learn all state-of-the-art frameworks. 
- I've always worked in team-based and time-constrained environments and now I am ready to take it to another level, developing software solutions.
